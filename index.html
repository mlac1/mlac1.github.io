              <p>With the rising popularity of rideshares, I worked with a team during 
                a hackathon and created an app 
                  that puts users in a safer position while pursuing these options and 
                  relieves any worry or stress from loved ones during these rideshares.</p>

                    </a>
                  <br>
              <h4>Inspiration</h4>
        
              <p>
                  We wanted to make an app that helps anyone using ride-sharing,
                   have the ability to easily give out information regarding their ride. 
                   We based this off of our experiences when we would ask our friends to 
                   let us know if they got home safely, but occasionally they’d forget. 
                   So, we wanted to make an app that makes it easier for them to give out
                    and provide more information about where they will be, while also giving 
                    them the option to notify certain individuals of emergencies.
                Because a portion of our app includes emergency notifications, 
                we wanted the general UI of the app to appear discreet about this aspect of it.
                 This is also the reason why we named our app "Knight Owl," because it plays off our 
                 night theme, while subtly hinting at the fact that this app can be very helpful.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>What it does</h4>
        
              <p>
                  Knight Owl works with one mode of transportation (Lyft). 
                  It allows users to fill out information about their trip, which
                   would be their current location and ending destination. 
                   They can also provide the name of their Lyft driver and 
                   the license plate of the car they are riding in. 
                  When the user starts their trip, reaches their destination, 
                  or run into a problem, trusted individuals are notified through text messages.
              </p>
        
              <br>
              <h4>How we built it</h4>
        
              <p>
                  We build it using Java, Android Studio, and SMS Manager. For the UI, we used Adobe Illustrator and Adobe XD.
              </p>
        
              <br>
    
              <h4>
                Challenges we ran into
              </h4>
        
              <p>
                  We had difficulty setting up the text messaging alerts that
                   would notifying the user's selected recipients. We attempted 
                   to use Twilio’s API to send SMS messages to our phones but it
                    was very time consuming and we were unable to download Ngrok 
                    and figure out how other applications such as Spark and IntelliJ
                     work together to send texts through Twilio. After many hours of
                      research and trial and error, we were finally able to send text
                  messages through SMS Manager. Additionally, none of us had experience with
                   Android so we had to learn about the ins and outs of Android studio.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>What is next for KnightOwl?</h4>
        
              <p>
                  In the future, we’re thinking of implementing a location
                   tracking feature that allows friends and family members 
                   to see users’ locations in real time and sync with the
                    ride sharing application being used so users won’t have to 
                    input details about their ride. Furthermore, to make it easier
                     to start a trip, the application may possibly include the functionality
                      for users to create labels for locations they frequent (eg. work, home, etc).
                       We would also like to include other modes of transportation, not just ride-sharing apps.
                        After further implementing other useful functionalities, we hope to improve user 
                        experience and scope by redesigning the application for flexibility and efficiency
                         of use and by making the application compatible with multiple phone OS’s. One more 
                         useful feature we would want to add in the future is that if the user doesn't signal
                          their safe arrival in the estimated time their trip would take, their friends would be notified.

        <h3>Formation and Evolution in Ideology</h3>
        <div class="third">
              
            <p> I collaborated with a research team part of a multidisciplinary design program. We
              focused on a cultural consensus model approach for mapping religious ideologies. I 
              assisted in survey design and data gathering. The research I conducted
              was valuable experience for potential grad school as I learned how to write
               about the processes, procedures, findings, and implications of research. Below is 
               the final poster of the project and its findings.

              <div class="first">
                  <p>
                    Over the span of 3 months, I collaborated with a team to redesign the website for the motel,
                    Startlight Inn, for the project course in Human Computer Interaction. We set out to evaluate 
                    and redesign the website. I conducted a competitive analysis, heuristic evaluation to understand
                    usability problems with the website. I created and conducted surveys and interviews
                      to gather data about user experiene and I created prototypes, wireframes, 
                      and mockups for an improved redesigned website. Attached below is the final report
                      summing up our findings and redesigns.

            For this project, I created a Specifications and Requirements document for a
            web application that provides a way to handle
              emergency requests and work toward providing a safe campus for UCI affiliates.
              I worked with my project team to create analysis models to understand users, goals 
              and use cases. I also conducted surveys and interviews to understand and analyze
        
              requirements. Attached below is the SRS document.
