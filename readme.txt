--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
    I included the following basic features:
    -At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute. 
        I included several images in my portfolio. All images had an alt attribute. 
        I had an image of myself and some project images. 

    -Appropriate headings and paragraph text
        I had a heading for each section of each html page with appropriate paragraph
        text. I had different headings and subheadings for different topics. 

    -Links to external page(s)
        I included links to my Linkedn and Github at the footer of each page. 
        When users click on the Linkedn or Github icon, they are redirected 
        to the link. 

    -Multiple pages, with appropriate navigation between them
        I created 5 html pages (Home, Projects, Resume, About, Media)
        with navigation between all pages. Users can switch to any 
        of these pages using the navigation bar on the top 
        of each page. 

    -Semantic HTML tags
        My portfolio had appropriate semantic HTML tags such as 
        header, body, footer, table, section, figure, figurecaption, 
        and nav. 
        
    -Added custom icons from Google Material Icons
        I downloaded and used the png of several icons from Google Material Icons 
        to create icons for the navigation bar. I had a home icon, media icon, 
        clipboard icon, folder icon, and person icon. 


(b) CSS features
    -Modified padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability:
        I added padding and margins to different parts of my portfolio to make
        content look nicer and make it easier for the user to read information. 
        For instance, I modified the margins and padding of all body content
        to be within 80 percent of the page in width. I also modified 
        margins and padding of different sections to make them more distinct. 
        Additionally, some sections had a rounded corner for aesthetic. I 
        modified margins so that each heading content is separated in a 
        organized manner. Paragraphs pertaining to a specific topic
        is close to its related heading but farther from other headings. 
    
        
    -Modified link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing:
        I used a color pallete I generated using a pallete creator called
        coolors. I used different tones of purple for background
        sections and white for text color. I modified links to have 
        a visually appealing effect when the user hovers their mouse over
        them. When links are being hovered, the text and icon of the link 
        changes to show a grey box shadow, blue text, and a grey background. 
        When users click on a link, the background of the link also changes 
        color to back and the text also becomes blue while clicked to 
        indicate that an action is occuring. 

 
    -Adding custom font(s) from Google fonts to add more personality
        I used the fonts: Rubik, Lexend and Amaranth to make 
        the portfolio look more appealing. I also included 
        fallback fonts such as Arial, Helvetica, and sans-serif. 

    -Responsive layout 
        To ensure that the portfolio has a responsive design, I set media
        queries in order to add breakpoints and different pixels. At these
        breakpoints, I would modify elements of each page so that elements 
        such as images, videos, lists, and the navigation bar are 
        organized to fit in different screen sizes. 


(c) Advanced features
    -Creating a table with multiple columns and rows which can be read via a screen reader
        I created a table of my skillsets with three columns (concepts I'm familiar with, 
        programming languages, and software), a table header, and six rows. This table
        has a caption to explain what the table is, table headers, table rows, standard 
        cells (td), and a scope for each table header so that screen readers can inform 
        the user that the table headers are columns. 


    -Creating a more complex page layout, such as including a sidebar or navigation bar
        I created a fixed navigation bar on the top of the page that stays on the top
        so users can go to a different page even if they are at the bottom or middle of
        the current page. The navigation bar is also responsive when the page size changes
        (eg. when the page is too small to fit all navigation items 
        horizontally, items are pushed into two rows and items aligning to the right.)
        The navigation bar has a name for each page as well as an icon next to each name. 
        Each item on the navigation bar changes in color and appearance when a mouse 
        is hovered over it or it is selected. 

    -Embedded HTML5 media, like video or audio, with fallbacks
        I embedded an mp4 video file, youtube video, and a mp3 audio file in 
        the Media page of my portfolio. Each embedded HTML5 media element has 
        a fallback message which informs the user that their browser does
        not support html5 media and provides an external link to the media content.
    


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    It took around 50 hours total to complete the assignment, spaced out between several days.


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
I used professor epsteins notes on html and other resources posted on 
his website such as w3schools, AC checker, MDN webdocs, Google icons, and color picking/pallete 
websites.
